16,How does conducting email sweeps help manage interruptions?,"['People, for some reason, feel much worse interrupting you if\nyou are wearing headphones than if you’re not.\nIt’s great — a lot of the time, people will walk up to you, start\nto say something, notice the headphones, apologize (using exag-\ngerated mouth motions), and walk away.\nThis is great — half the time they didn’t actually need to talk to\nyou, and the other half of the time they can send an email that\nyou can process at the end of the day during the second of your\ntwo daily email sweeps.\nHere’s the best part: you don’t actually have to be listening to\nanything.']","Conducting email sweeps helps manage interruptions by allowing people to send emails instead of approaching you directly, reducing unnecessary interruptions. This way, you can process the emails at specific times during the day, minimizing distractions and maintaining focus on your tasks.",reasoning,"[{'source': 'https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/08/The-pmarca-Blog-Archives.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/08/The-pmarca-Blog-Archives.pdf', 'page': 140, 'total_pages': 195, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'The Pmarca Blog Archives', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Mac OS X 10.10 Quartz PDFContext', 'creationDate': ""D:20150110020418Z00'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20150110020418Z00'00'"", 'trapped': ''}]",True
17,"Why is planning interview questions in advance important for marketing professionals, given the challenges of effective candidate interviews?","['For a marketing person — have them whiteboard out a launch\nfor your new product.\nThird, plan out and write down interview questions ahead of\ntime.\nI’m assuming that you know the right interview questions for\nthe role — and frankly, if you don’t, you probably shouldn’t be\nthe hiring manager for that position.\nThe problem I’m addressing is: most people don’t know how to\ninterview a candidate.\nAnd even people who do know how, aren’t necessarily good at\ncoming up with questions on the Yy.\nSo just make sure you have questions planned out and assigned\nto each interviewer ahead of time.']","Planning interview questions in advance is important for marketing professionals because it ensures that the interview process is structured, relevant, and effective. By having questions prepared ahead of time, interviewers can focus on assessing the candidate's skills, experience, and fit for the role, rather than scrambling to come up with questions on the spot. This approach helps to standardize the interview process, ensure consistency in evaluation criteria, and ultimately select the best candidate for the position.",reasoning,"[{'source': 'https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/08/The-pmarca-Blog-Archives.pdf', 'file_path': 'https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/08/The-pmarca-Blog-Archives.pdf', 'page': 81, 'total_pages': 195, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'The Pmarca Blog Archives', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': '', 'producer': 'Mac OS X 10.10 Quartz PDFContext', 'creationDate': ""D:20150110020418Z00'00'"", 'modDate': ""D:20150110020418Z00'00'"", 'trapped': ''}]",True
