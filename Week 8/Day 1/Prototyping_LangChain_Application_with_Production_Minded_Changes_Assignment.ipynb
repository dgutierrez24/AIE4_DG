This framework was \\nreleased one year after OSTP announced the launch of a process to develop “a bill of rights for an AI-powered \\nworld.” Its release follows a year of public engagement to inform this initiative. The framework is available \\nonline at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights \\nAbout the Office of Science and Technology Policy \\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and Technology \\nPolicy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to provide the President and others within the Executive Office \\nof the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national \\nsecurity, health, foreign relations, the environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, among \\nother topics. OSTP leads interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts, assists the Office of \\nManagement and Budget (OMB) with an annual review and analysis of Federal research and development in \\nbudgets, and serves as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with \\nrespect to major policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government. \\nLegal Disclaimer \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People is a white paper \\npublished by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. It is intended to support the \\ndevelopment of policies and practices that protect civil rights and promote democratic values in the building, \\ndeployment, and governance of automated systems. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is non-binding and does not constitute U.S. government policy. It \\ndoes not supersede, modify, or direct an interpretation of any existing statute, regulation, policy, or \\ninternational instrument. It does not constitute binding guidance for the public or Federal agencies and \\ntherefore does not require compliance with the principles described herein. It also is not determinative of what \\nthe U.S. government’s position will be in any international negotiation. Adoption of these principles may not \\nmeet the requirements of existing statutes, regulations, policies, or international instruments, or the \\nrequirements of the Federal agencies that enforce them. These principles are not intended to, and do not, \\nprohibit or limit any lawful activity of a government agency, including law enforcement, national security, or \\nintelligence activities. \\nThe appropriate application of the principles set forth in this white paper depends significantly on the \\ncontext in which automated systems are being utilized. In some circumstances, application of these principles \\nin whole or in part may not be appropriate given the intended use of automated systems to achieve government \\nagency missions. Future sector-specific guidance will likely be necessary and important for guiding the use of \\nautomated systems in certain settings such as AI systems used as part of school building security or automated \\nhealth diagnostic systems. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights recognizes that law enforcement activities require a balancing of \\nequities, for example, between the protection of sensitive law enforcement information and the principle of \\nnotice; as such, notice may not be appropriate, or may need to be adjusted to protect sources, methods, and \\nother law enforcement equities. Even in contexts where these principles may not apply in whole or in part, \\nfederal departments and agencies remain subject to judicial, privacy, and civil liberties oversight as well as \\nexisting policies and safeguards that govern automated systems, including, for example, Executive Order 13960, \\nPromoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government (December 2020). \\nThis white paper recognizes that national security (which includes certain law enforcement and \\nhomeland security activities) and defense activities are of increased sensitivity and interest to our nation’s \\nadversaries and are often subject to special requirements, such as those governing classified information and \\nother protected data. Such activities require alternative, compatible safeguards through existing policies that \\ngovern automated systems and AI, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) AI Ethical Principles and \\nResponsible AI Implementation Pathway and the Intelligence Community (IC) AI Ethics Principles and \\nFramework. The implementation of these policies to national security and defense activities can be informed by \\nthe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights where feasible. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is not intended to, and does not, create any legal right, benefit, or \\ndefense, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its \\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person, nor does it constitute a \\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. \\nCopyright Information \\nThis document is a work of the United States Government and is in the public domain (see 17 U.S.C. §105). \\n2\\n'),\n",

Too often, these tools are used to limit our opportunities and \\nprevent our access to critical resources or services. These problems are well documented. In America and around \\nthe world, systems supposed to help with patient care have proven unsafe, ineffective, or biased. Algorithms used \\nin hiring and credit decisions have been found to reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities or embed \\nnew harmful bias and discrimination. Unchecked social media data collection has been used to threaten people’s \\nopportunities, undermine their privacy, or pervasively track their activity—often without their knowledge or \\nconsent. \\nThese outcomes are deeply harmful—but they are not inevitable. Automated systems have brought about extraor-\\ndinary benefits, from technology that helps farmers grow food more efficiently and computers that predict storm \\npaths, to algorithms that can identify diseases in patients. These tools now drive important decisions across \\nsectors, while data is helping to revolutionize global industries. Fueled by the power of American innovation, \\nthese tools hold the potential to redefine every part of our society and make life better for everyone. \\nThis important progress must not come at the price of civil rights or democratic values, foundational American \\nprinciples that President Biden has affirmed as a cornerstone of his Administration. On his first day in office, the \\nPresident ordered the full Federal government to work to root out inequity, embed fairness in decision-\\nmaking processes, and affirmatively advance civil rights, equal opportunity, and racial justice in America.1 The \\nPresident has spoken forcefully about the urgent challenges posed to democracy today and has regularly called \\non people of conscience to act to preserve civil rights—including the right to privacy, which he has called “the \\nbasis for so many more rights that we have come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this \\ncountry.”2\\nTo advance President Biden’s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified \\nfive principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American \\npublic in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that \\nprotects all people from these threats—and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. \\nResponding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, \\ntechnologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by a technical \\ncompanion—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including \\ndetailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help \\nprovide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public’s rights, opportunities, \\nor access to critical needs. \\n3\\n'),\n",

Developed through extensive consultation with the American public, these principles are \\na blueprint for building and deploying automated systems that are aligned with democratic values and protect \\ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes this Foreword, the five \\nprinciples, notes on Applying the The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and a Technical Companion that gives \\nconcrete steps that can be taken by many kinds of organizations—from governments at all levels to companies of \\nall sizes—to uphold these values. Experts from across the private sector, governments, and international \\nconsortia have published principles and frameworks to guide the responsible use of automated systems; this \\nframework provides a national values statement and toolkit that is sector-agnostic to inform building these \\nprotections into policy, practice, or the technological design process.  Where existing law or policy—such as \\nsector-specific privacy laws and oversight requirements—do not already provide guidance, the Blueprint for an \\nAI Bill of Rights should be used to inform policy decisions.\\nLISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long process to seek and distill input \\nfrom people across the country—from impacted communities and industry stakeholders to technology develop-\\ners and other experts across fields and sectors, as well as policymakers throughout the Federal government—on \\nthe issue of algorithmic and data-driven harms and potential remedies. Through panel discussions, public listen-\\ning sessions, meetings, a formal request for information, and input to a publicly accessible and widely-publicized \\nemail address, people throughout the United States, public servants across Federal agencies, and members of the \\ninternational community spoke up about both the promises and potential harms of these technologies, and \\nplayed a central role in shaping the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The core messages gleaned from these \\ndiscussions include that AI has transformative potential to improve Americans’ lives, and that preventing the \\nharms of these technologies is both necessary and achievable. The Appendix includes a full list of public engage-\\nments. \\n4\\n'),\n",

Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \\nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \\nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \\nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \\nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \\nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \\nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \\nmoving principles into practice. \\nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \\nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \\nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \\nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \\nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \\ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\\xad\\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \\ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \\nother countries. \\nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\\xad\\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\\xad\\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\\xad\\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \\norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \\nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \\nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \\nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \\nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government’s use of AI. The Blueprint \\nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \\non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \\nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \\nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \\nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \\nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \\npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \\nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \\napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \\nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \\nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \\ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \\n9\\n'),\n",

Depending on the specific circumstances, such algorithmic discrimination may violate \\nlegal protections. Throughout this framework the term “algorithmic discrimination” takes this meaning (and \\nnot a technical understanding of discrimination as distinguishing between items). \\nAUTOMATED SYSTEM: An \"automated system\" is any system, software, or process that uses computation as \\nwhole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect \\ndata or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities. Automated systems \\ninclude, but are not limited to, systems derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing \\nor artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. “Passive computing \\ninfrastructure” is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision, \\nmake or aid in decisions, inform policy implementation, or collect data or observations, including web \\nhosting, domain registration, networking, caching, data storage, or cybersecurity. Throughout this \\nframework, automated systems that are considered in scope are only those that have the potential to \\nmeaningfully impact individuals’ or communi-ties’ rights, opportunities, or access. \\nCOMMUNITIES: “Communities” include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and \\noffline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organi-\\nzational ties. This includes Tribes, Clans, Bands, Rancherias, Villages, and other Indigenous communities. AI \\nand other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause \\nharm to individuals. But the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of com-\\nmunities. Accordingly, the concept of community is integral to the scope of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. \\nUnited States law and policy have long employed approaches for protecting the rights of individuals, but exist-\\ning frameworks have sometimes struggled to provide protections when effects manifest most clearly at a com-\\nmunity level. For these reasons, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights asserts that the harms of automated \\nsystems should be evaluated, protected against, and redressed at both the individual and community levels. \\nEQUITY: “Equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. \\nSystemic, fair, and just treatment must take into account the status of individuals who belong to underserved \\ncommunities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American \\npersons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; \\nwomen, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) \\npersons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely \\naffected by persistent poverty or inequality. \\nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS: “Rights, opportunities, or access” is used to indicate the scoping \\nof this framework. It describes the set of: civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, \\nvoting, and protections from discrimination, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of \\nprivacy and other freedoms in both public and private sector contexts; equal opportunities, including equitable \\naccess to education, housing, credit, employment, and other programs; or, access to critical resources or \\nservices, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, non-deceptive information about goods \\nand services, and government benefits. \\n10\\n'),\n",

Data and metadata generated by or about \\nthose who are not yet legal adults is also sensitive, even if not related to a sensitive domain. Such data includes, \\nbut is not limited to, numerical, text, image, audio, or video data. \\nSENSITIVE DOMAINS: “Sensitive domains” are those in which activities being conducted can cause material \\nharms, including significant adverse effects on human rights such as autonomy and dignity, as well as civil liber\\xad\\nties and civil rights. Domains that have historically been singled out as deserving of enhanced data protections \\nor where such enhanced protections are reasonably expected by the public include, but are not limited to, \\nhealth, family planning and care, employment, education, criminal justice, and personal finance. In the context \\nof this framework, such domains are considered sensitive whether or not the specifics of a system context \\nwould necessitate coverage under existing law, and domains and data that are considered sensitive are under\\xad\\nstood to change over time based on societal norms and context. \\nSURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY: “Surveillance technology” refers to products or services marketed for \\nor that can be lawfully used to detect, monitor, intercept, collect, exploit, preserve, protect, transmit, and/or \\nretain data, identifying information, or communications concerning individuals or groups.

This technical companion considers each principle in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and \\nprovides examples and concrete steps for communities, industry, governments, and others to take in order to \\nbuild these protections into policy, practice, or the technological design process. \\nTaken together, the technical protections and practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can help \\nguard the American public against many of the potential and actual harms identified by researchers, technolo\\xad\\ngists, advocates, journalists, policymakers, and communities in the United States and around the world. This \\ntechnical companion is intended to be used as a reference by people across many circumstances – anyone \\nimpacted by automated systems, and anyone developing, designing, deploying, evaluating, or making policy to \\ngovern the use of an automated system. \\nEach principle is accompanied by three supplemental sections: \\n1\\n2\\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT: \\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems that the principle seeks to address and protect against, including \\nillustrative examples. \\nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS: \\n• The expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional technical\\nstandards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts.\\n• This section outlines practical steps that can be implemented to realize the vision of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The \\nexpectations laid out often mirror existing practices for technology development, including pre-deployment testing, ongoing \\nmonitoring, and governance structures for automated systems, but also go further to address unmet needs for change and offer \\nconcrete directions for how those changes can be made. \\n• Expectations about reporting are intended for the entity developing or using the automated system. The resulting reports can \\nbe provided to the public, regulators, auditors, industry standards groups, or others engaged in independent review, and should \\nbe made public as much as possible consistent with law, regulation, and policy, and noting that intellectual property, law \\nenforcement, or national security considerations may prevent public release. Where public reports are not possible, the \\ninformation should be provided to oversight bodies and privacy, civil liberties, or other ethics officers charged with safeguard \\ning individuals’ rights. These reporting expectations are important for transparency, so the American people can have\\nconfidence that their rights, opportunities, and access as well as their expectations about technologies are respected. \\n3\\nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE: \\nThis section provides real-life examples of how these guiding principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practices. \\nIt describes practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \\nThe examples provided are not critiques or endorsements, but rather are offered as illustrative cases to help \\nprovide a concrete vision for actualizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.

In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. \\nAutomated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\\xad\\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.

Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that \\nkey development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through \\npre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\\xad\\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop\\xad\\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \\nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly. Expanded, proactive protections could build on \\nthese existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public. Inno\\xad\\nvators deserve clear rules of the road that allow new ideas to flourish, and the American public deserves protections \\nfrom unsafe outcomes. All can benefit from assurances that automated systems will be designed, tested, and consis\\xad\\ntently confirmed to work as intended, and that they will be proactively protected from foreseeable unintended harm\\xad\\nful outcomes. \\n•\\nA proprietary model was developed to predict the likelihood of sepsis in hospitalized patients and was imple\\xad\\nmented at hundreds of hospitals around the country.

These expectations are explained below. \\nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \\nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \\nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\\xad\\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\\xad\\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\\xad\\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \\nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \\ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \\nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \\napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \\non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \\nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \\nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \\nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \\ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \\ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \\noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \\nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \\nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \\naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \\nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \\nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \\nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \\nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\\xad\\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \\npotential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \\ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \\nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\\xad\\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \\nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \\nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\\xad\\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi\\xad\\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \\n18\\n'),\n",

This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and \\nharm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well \\nas ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system. Monitor\\xad\\ning should take into account the performance of both technical system components (the algorithm as well as \\nany hardware components, data inputs, etc.) and human operators. It should include mechanisms for testing \\nthe actual accuracy of any predictions or recommendations generated by a system, not just a human operator’s \\ndetermination of their accuracy. Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor\\xad\\ning as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems. These monitoring proce\\xad\\ndures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system. \\nClear organizational oversight. Entities responsible for the development or use of automated systems \\nshould lay out clear governance structures and procedures.  This includes clearly-stated governance proce\\xad\\ndures before deploying the system, as well as responsibility of specific individuals or entities to oversee ongoing \\nassessment and mitigation. Organizational stakeholders including those with oversight of the business process \\nor operation being automated, as well as other organizational divisions that may be affected due to the use of \\nthe system, should be involved in establishing governance procedures. Responsibility should rest high enough \\nin the organization that decisions about resources, mitigation, incident response, and potential rollback can be \\nmade promptly, with sufficient weight given to risk mitigation objectives against competing concerns. Those \\nholding this responsibility should be made aware of any use cases with the potential for meaningful impact on \\npeople’s rights, opportunities, or access as determined based on risk identification procedures.

These principles—while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \\nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI—require that AI is: (a) lawful and \\nrespectful of our Nation’s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \\nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\\nent; and, (i) accountable. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is consistent with the Executive Order. \\nAffected agencies across the federal government have released AI use case inventories13 and are implementing \\nplans to bring those AI systems into compliance with the Executive Order or retire them. \\nThe law and policy landscape for motor vehicles shows that strong safety regulations—and \\nmeasures to address harms when they occur—can enhance innovation in the context of com-\\nplex technologies. Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. \\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \\nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers’ ability to \\ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \\nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \\norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \\ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \\nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \\nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \\nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \\nand effectiveness concerns. \\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \\nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \\npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \\ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \\nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \\nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \\nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \\nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \\ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \\ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \\nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \\nharmful \\nuses. \\nThe \\nNIST \\nframework \\nwill \\nconsider \\nand \\nencompass \\nprinciples \\nsuch \\nas \\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design, design and development, deployment, use, \\nand testing and evaluation of AI technologies and systems.

For example, facial recognition technology that can contribute to wrongful and discriminatory \\narrests,31 hiring algorithms that inform discriminatory decisions, and healthcare algorithms that discount \\nthe severity of certain diseases in Black Americans. Instances of discriminatory practices built into and \\nresulting from AI and other automated systems exist across many industries, areas, and contexts. While automated \\nsystems have the capacity to drive extraordinary advances and innovations, algorithmic discrimination \\nprotections should be built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use. \\nMany companies, non-profits, and federal government agencies are already taking steps to ensure the public \\nis protected from algorithmic discrimination. Some companies have instituted bias testing as part of their product \\nquality assessment and launch procedures, and in some cases this testing has led products to be changed or not \\nlaunched, preventing harm to the public. Federal government agencies have been developing standards and guidance \\nfor the use of automated systems in order to help prevent bias. Non-profits and companies have developed best \\npractices for audits and impact assessments to help identify potential algorithmic discrimination and provide \\ntransparency to the public in the mitigation of such biases. \\nBut there is much more work to do to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination to use and design \\nautomated systems in an equitable way. The guardrails protecting the public from discrimination in their daily \\nlives should include their digital lives and impacts—basic safeguards against abuse, bias, and discrimination to \\nensure that all people are treated fairly when automated systems are used. This includes all dimensions of their \\nlives, from hiring to loan approvals, from medical treatment and payment to encounters with the criminal \\njustice system. Ensuring equity should also go beyond existing guardrails to consider the holistic impact that \\nautomated systems make on underserved communities and to institute proactive protections that support these \\ncommunities. \\n•\\nAn automated system using nontraditional factors such as educational attainment and employment history as\\npart of its loan underwriting and pricing model was found to be much more likely to charge an applicant who\\nattended a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) higher loan prices for refinancing a student loan\\nthan an applicant who did not attend an HBCU. This was found to be true even when controlling for\\nother credit-related factors.32\\n•\\nA hiring tool that learned the features of a company's employees (predominantly men) rejected women appli\\xad\\ncants for spurious and discriminatory reasons; resumes with the word “women’s,” such as “women’s\\nchess club captain,” were penalized in the candidate ranking.33\\n•\\nA predictive model marketed as being able to predict whether students are likely to drop out of school was\\nused by more than 500 universities across the country. The model was found to use race directly as a predictor,\\nand also shown to have large disparities by race; Black students were as many as four times as likely as their\\notherwise similar white peers to be deemed at high risk of dropping out. These risk scores are used by advisors \\nto guide students towards or away from majors, and some worry that they are being used to guide\\nBlack students away from math and science subjects.34\\n•\\nA risk assessment tool designed to predict the risk of recidivism for individuals in federal custody showed\\nevidence of disparity in prediction. The tool overpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on the\\ngeneral recidivism tools, and underpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on some of the\\nviolent recidivism tools.

Protection against algorithmic discrimination should include designing to ensure equity, broadly \\nconstrued.  Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \\nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \\nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \\neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \\nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \\nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \\nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \\nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \\nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \\ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \\neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \\nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \\nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \\nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \\notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \\nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \\ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \\nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \\nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \\nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \\nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \\nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \\ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \\na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \\navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \\ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \\nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \\nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \\ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \\ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \\nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \\norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \\nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \\n26\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n'),\n",

Systems should be \\ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\\xad\\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \\nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\\xad\\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \\nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\\xad\\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \\nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \\n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \\norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\\xad\\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\\xad\\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \\nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \\ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \\ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\\xad\\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \\njustification for any continued use of the system. \\nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \\nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \\nthe disparity may be required by law. \\nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \\ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \\nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \\nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \\ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \\nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \\ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \\nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \\nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \\nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\\xad\\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \\naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \\ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \\ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\\xad\\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \\nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \\ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \\nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \\nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \\nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \\nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \\n27\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n\"),\n",

The Depart\\xad\\nment of Justice has launched a nationwide initiative to combat redlining, which includes reviewing how \\nlenders who may be avoiding serving communities of color are conducting targeted marketing and advertising.51 \\nThis initiative will draw upon strong partnerships across federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial \\nProtection Bureau and prudential regulators. The Action Plan to Advance Property Appraisal and Valuation \\nEquity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a \\nnondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for Automated Valuation Models.52\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly \\nlaid out how employers’ use of AI and other automated systems can result in \\ndiscrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain \\nhow employers’ use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements \\nunder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). This technical assistance also provides practical \\ntips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their \\nrights may have been violated. \\nDisparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access. A widely \\nused healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient’s past medical care to predict future medical needs, \\nrecommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated \\nagainst Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost \\nthan white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed \\npractical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health \\nconditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.54 \\nLarge employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used \\nfor hiring. An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured \\nquestionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers. It covers \\nspecific technical questions such as the training data used, model training process, biases identified, and \\nmitigation steps employed.55 \\nStandards organizations have developed guidelines to incorporate accessibility criteria \\ninto technology design processes. The most prevalent in the United States is the Access Board’s Section \\n508 regulations,56 which are the technical standards for federal information communication technology (software, \\nhardware, and web).

Surveil\\xad\\nlance and data collection, sharing, use, and reuse now sit at the foundation of business models across many industries, \\nwith more and more companies tracking the behavior of the American public, building individual profiles based on \\nthis data, and using this granular-level information as input into automated systems that further track, profile, and \\nimpact the American public. Government agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, also use and help develop \\na variety of technologies that enhance and expand surveillance capabilities, which similarly collect data used as input \\ninto other automated systems that directly impact people’s lives. Federal law has not grown to address the expanding \\nscale of private data collection, or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means \\nof private collection.  \\nMeanwhile, members of the American public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions \\nabout its collection and use. Data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without \\nconsumers’ permission or knowledge.60 Moreover, there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to \\nmake decisions about their lives, such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job. Use of surveillance \\ntechnologies has increased in schools and workplaces, and, when coupled with consequential management and \\nevaluation decisions, it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and \\na reduced ability to use analytical reasoning.61 Documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by \\ndata brokers to profile communities in harmful ways.62 The impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive, \\nbreeding distrust, anxiety, and other mental health problems; chilling speech, protest, and worker organizing; and \\nthreatening our democratic process.63 The American public should be protected from these growing risks. \\nIncreasingly, some companies are taking these concerns seriously and integrating mechanisms to protect consumer \\nprivacy into their products by design and by default, including by minimizing the data they collect, communicating \\ncollection and use clearly, and improving security practices. Federal government surveillance and other collection and \\nuse of data is governed by legal protections that help to protect civil liberties and provide for limits on data retention \\nin some cases. Many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these \\nharms. \\nHowever, these are not yet standard practices, and the United States lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory \\nframework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data.

The American public should be protect\\xad\\ned via built-in privacy protections, data minimization, use and collection limitations, and transparency, in addition \\nto being entitled to clear mechanisms to control access to and use of their data—including their metadata—in a \\nproactive, informed, and ongoing way. Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data \\nshould meet these expectations. \\nProtect privacy by design and by default \\nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\\xad\\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \\nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \\nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \\ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data \\ncollection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should \\nonly be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and \\nuse is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience \\nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \\nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \\nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \\nnarrow identified goals, to avoid \"mission creep.\"  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \\nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on \\nthese identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for \\nnew privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. \\nClear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance \\nwith legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\\xad\\nfied. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should \\nattempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\\xad\\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \\noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \\ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \\nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \\nPrivacy-preserving security. Entities creating, using, or governing automated systems should follow \\nprivacy and security best practices designed to ensure data and metadata do not leak beyond the specific \\nconsented use case. Best practices could include using privacy-enhancing cryptography or other types of \\nprivacy-enhancing technologies or fine-grained permissions and access control mechanisms, along with \\nconventional system security protocols. \\n33\\n'),\n",

Surveillance or monitoring systems should be subject to \\nheightened oversight that includes at a minimum assessment of potential harms during design (before deploy\\xad\\nment) and in an ongoing manner, to ensure that the American public’s rights, opportunities, and access are \\nprotected. This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \\nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \\nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \\nsystem is in use. \\nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \\nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \\nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \\nminimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and \\nnational security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice \\nbefore it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \\nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil \\nrights must not be limited by the threat of surveillance or harassment facilitated or aided by an automated \\nsystem. Surveillance systems should not be used to monitor the exercise of democratic rights, such as voting, \\nprivacy, peaceful assembly, speech, or association, in a way that limits the exercise of civil rights or civil liber\\xad\\nties. Information about or algorithmically-determined assumptions related to identity should be carefully \\nlimited if used to target or guide surveillance systems in order to avoid algorithmic discrimination; such iden\\xad\\ntity-related information includes group characteristics or affiliations, geographic designations, location-based \\nand association-based inferences, social networks, and biometrics. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \\nsystems should not be used in physical or digital workplaces (regardless of employment status), public educa\\xad\\ntional institutions, and public accommodations. Continuous surveillance and monitoring systems should not \\nbe used in a way that has the effect of limiting access to critical resources or services or suppressing the exer\\xad\\ncise of rights, even where the organization is not under a particular duty to protect those rights. \\nProvide the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and \\ncontrol over their data \\nUse-specific consent. Consent practices should not allow for abusive surveillance practices. Where data \\ncollectors or automated systems seek consent, they should seek it for specific, narrow use contexts, for specif\\xad\\nic time durations, and for use by specific entities. Consent should not extend if any of these conditions change; \\nconsent should be re-acquired before using data if the use case changes, a time limit elapses, or data is trans\\xad\\nferred to another entity (including being shared or sold). Consent requested should be limited in scope and \\nshould not request consent beyond what is required. Refusal to provide consent should be allowed, without \\nadverse effects, to the greatest extent possible based on the needs of the use case. \\nBrief and direct consent requests. When seeking consent from users short, plain language consent \\nrequests should be used so that users understand for what use contexts, time span, and entities they are \\nproviding data and metadata consent. User experience research should be performed to ensure these consent \\nrequests meet performance standards for readability and comprehension. This includes ensuring that consent \\nrequests are accessible to users with disabilities and are available in the language(s) and reading level appro\\xad\\npriate for the audience.

Summary reporting should include the \\nresults of any surveillance pre-deployment assessment, including disparity assessment in the real-world \\ndeployment context, the specific identified goals of any data collection, and the assessment done to ensure \\nonly the minimum required data is collected. It should also include documentation about the scope limit \\nassessments, including data retention timelines and associated justification, and an assessment of the \\nimpact of surveillance or data collection on rights, opportunities, and access.

Depending on the technological use case and \\nbased on an ethical assessment, consent for sensitive data may need to be acquired from a guardian and/or child. \\nProvide enhanced protections for data related to sensitive domains \\nNecessary functions only. Sensitive data should only be used for functions strictly necessary for that \\ndomain or for functions that are required for administrative reasons (e.g., school attendance records), unless \\nconsent is acquired, if appropriate, and the additional expectations in this section are met. Consent for non-\\nnecessary functions should be optional, i.e., should not be required, incentivized, or coerced in order to \\nreceive opportunities or access to services. In cases where data is provided to an entity (e.g., health insurance \\ncompany) in order to facilitate payment for such a need, that data should only be used for that purpose. \\nEthical review and use prohibitions. Any use of sensitive data or decision process based in part on sensi-\\ntive data that might limit rights, opportunities, or access, whether the decision is automated or not, should go \\nthrough a thorough ethical review and monitoring, both in advance and by periodic review (e.g., via an indepen-\\ndent ethics committee or similarly robust process). In some cases, this ethical review may determine that data \\nshould not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent. Some novel uses of automated systems in this \\ncontext, where the algorithm is dynamically developing and where the science behind the use case is not well \\nestablished, may also count as human subject experimentation, and require special review under organizational \\ncompliance bodies applying medical, scientific, and academic human subject experimentation ethics rules and \\ngovernance procedures. \\nData quality. In sensitive domains, entities should be especially careful to maintain the quality of data to \\navoid adverse consequences arising from decision-making based on flawed or inaccurate data. Such care is \\nnecessary in a fragmented, complex data ecosystem and for datasets that have limited access such as for fraud \\nprevention and law enforcement. It should be not left solely to individuals to carry the burden of reviewing and \\ncorrecting data. Entities should conduct regular, independent audits and take prompt corrective measures to \\nmaintain accurate, timely, and complete data. \\nLimit access to sensitive data and derived data. Sensitive data and derived data should not be sold, \\nshared, or made public as part of data brokerage or other agreements. Sensitive data includes data that can be \\nused to infer sensitive information; even systems that are not directly marketed as sensitive domain technologies \\nare expected to keep sensitive data private. Access to such data should be limited based on necessity and based \\non a principle of local control, such that those individuals closest to the data subject have more access while \\nthose who are less proximate do not (e.g., a teacher has access to their students’ daily progress data while a \\nsuperintendent does not). \\nReporting.

Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \\ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \\nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is “relevant and necessary” to \\naccomplish an agency’s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \\nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \\nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\\xad\\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \\nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \\nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \\ncomply with the Privacy Act’s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \\ncorrect an individual’s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \\nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual’s “qualifications, character, rights, … \\nopportunities…, or benefits.” \\nNIST’s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \\norganizations to manage privacy risks. The NIST Framework gives organizations ways to identify and \\ncommunicate their privacy risks and goals to support ethical decision-making in system, product, and service \\ndesign or deployment, as well as the measures they are taking to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws \\nor regulations. It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\\nA school board’s attempt to surveil public school students—undertaken without \\nadequate community input—sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \\nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state’s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \\n“biometric identifying technology” in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \\nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \\nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \\nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \\nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \\nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance \"where \\nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is […] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \\nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute\" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \\nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \\nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \\nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming. These choices—such as contextual, timely \\nalerts about location tracking—are brief, direct, and use-specific. Many of the expectations listed here for \\nprivacy by design and use-specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when \\ndeveloping for smart phone devices,82 such as being transparent about how user data will be used, asking for app \\npermissions during their use so that the use-context will be clear to users, and ensuring that the app will still \\nwork if users deny (or later revoke) some permissions. \\n39\\n'),\n",

But this \\nexpansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a \\nhiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\\xad\\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting \\ndecisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. \\nNotice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\\xad\\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \\nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. \\nClear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\\xad\\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a \\nparticular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, \\nunaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and \\nmore important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted \\nby those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline \\nrequirement. \\nProviding notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, \\nmaking a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such \\nas credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the \\nprocess of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many \\nforms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory \\nsystems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public \\ndeserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, \\nopportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the \\nvalidity and reasonable use of automated systems. \\n•\\nA lawyer representing an older client with disabilities who had been cut off from Medicaid-funded home\\nhealth-care assistance couldn't determine why, especially since the decision went against historical access\\npractices.

The Biometric Information Privacy Act enacted by the state contains a number of provisions \\nconcerning the use of individual biometric data and identifiers. Included among them is a provision that no private \\nentity may \"collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain\" such information about an \\nindividual, unless written notice is provided to that individual or their legally appointed representative. 87\\nMajor technology companies are piloting new ways to communicate with the public about \\ntheir automated technologies. For example, a collection of non-profit organizations and companies have \\nworked together to develop a framework that defines operational approaches to transparency for machine \\nlearning systems.88 This framework, and others like it,89 inform the public about the use of these tools, going \\nbeyond simple notice to include reporting elements such as safety evaluations, disparity assessments, and \\nexplanations of how the systems work. \\nLenders are required by federal law to notify consumers about certain decisions made about \\nthem. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances \\nthat consumers who are denied credit receive \"adverse action\" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a \\ncredit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an \"adverse action\" \\nnotice to the consumer, which includes \"notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application \\nor on an existing credit account.\"90 In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform \\nborrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \"they are getting worse terms because of \\ninformation in their credit report.\" The CFPB has also asserted that \"[t]he law gives every applicant the right to \\na specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because \\na company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn\\'t understand.\"92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value \\nthat certain decisions need to be explained. \\nA California law requires that warehouse employees are provided with notice and explana-\\ntion about quotas, potentially facilitated by automated systems, that apply to them. Warehous-\\ning employers in California that use quota systems (often facilitated by algorithmic monitoring systems) are \\nrequired to provide employees with a written description of each quota that applies to the employee, including \\n“quantified number of tasks to be performed or materials to be produced or handled, within the defined \\ntime period, and any potential adverse employment action that could result from failure to meet the quota.”93\\nAcross the federal government, agencies are conducting and supporting research on explain-\\nable AI systems. The NIST is conducting fundamental research on the explainability of AI systems. A multidis-\\nciplinary team of researchers aims to develop measurement methods and best practices to support the \\nimplementation of core tenets of explainable AI.94 The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has a \\nprogram on Explainable Artificial Intelligence that aims to create a suite of machine learning techniques that \\nproduce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction \\naccuracy), and enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and effectively manage the emerging \\ngeneration of artificially intelligent partners.95 The National Science Foundation’s program on Fairness in \\nArtificial Intelligence also includes a specific interest in research foundations for explainable AI.96\\n45\\n'),\n",

Yet members of the public are often \\npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \\nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \\nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \\nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \\nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\\xad\\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \\nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as “reasonable accommodations” for people \\nwith disabilities. \\nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \\nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \\ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \\nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \\nto wait—immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \\nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \\ncard access system fails. \\nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \\nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \\ndiagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous \\noutcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human \\noversight in such settings. \\nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to \\nprovide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still \\nin place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers \\noften retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an \\nairplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a \\nmisidentification. \\nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, \\nand access. People make mistakes, and a human alternative or fallback mechanism will not always have the right \\nanswer, but they serve as an important check on the power and validity of automated systems. \\n• An automated signature matching system is used as part of the voting process in many parts of the country to\\ndetermine whether the signature on a mail-in ballot matches the signature on file.

Some panelists suggested that the integration of technology \\ncould benefit from examining how technological diffusion has worked in the realm of urban planning: \\nlessons learned from successes and failures there include the importance of balancing ownership rights, use \\nrights, and community health, safety and welfare, as well ensuring better representation of all voices, \\nespecially those traditionally marginalized by technological advances.

The \\ndiscussion emphasized that communities deserve safety, and strategies need to be identified that lead to safety; \\nsuch strategies might include data-driven approaches, but the focus on safety should be primary, and \\ntechnology may or may not be part of an effective set of mechanisms to achieve safety. Various panelists raised \\nconcerns about the validity of these systems, the tendency of adverse or irrelevant data to lead to a replication of \\nunjust outcomes, and the confirmation bias and tendency of people to defer to potentially inaccurate automated \\nsystems. Throughout, many of the panelists individually emphasized that the impact of these systems on \\nindividuals and communities is potentially severe: the systems lack individualization and work against the \\nbelief that people can change for the better, system use can lead to the loss of jobs and custody of children, and \\nsurveillance can lead to chilling effects for communities and sends negative signals to community members \\nabout how they're viewed. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \\nthese technologies, various panelists emphasized that transparency is important but is not enough to achieve \\naccountability. Some panelists discussed their individual views on additional system needs for validity, and \\nagreed upon the importance of advisory boards and compensated community input early in the design process \\n(before the technology is built and instituted).

Education-related \\nconcerning uses included the increased use of remote proctoring systems, student location and facial \\nrecognition tracking, teacher evaluation systems, robot teachers, and more. Housing-related concerning uses \\nincluding automated tenant background screening and facial recognition-based controls to enter or exit \\nhousing complexes. Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring \\nscreening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key \\nconcern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student \\nrecords and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these \\ndomains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate \\ncontrol of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work \\nand life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists \\npointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's \\nopportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further \\naccess to housing.

Khadijah Abdurahman, Tech Impact Network Research Fellow, AI Now Institute, UCLA C2I1, and\\nUWA Law School\\nPanelists separately described the increasing scope of technology use in providing for social welfare, including \\nin fraud detection, digital ID systems, and other methods focused on improving efficiency and reducing cost. \\nHowever, various panelists individually cautioned that these systems may reduce burden for government \\nagencies by increasing the burden and agency of people using and interacting with these technologies. \\nAdditionally, these systems can produce feedback loops and compounded harm, collecting data from \\ncommunities and using it to reinforce inequality. Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \\nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \\nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \\nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \\ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \\nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \\nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \\nthem. \\nPanel 6: The Healthcare System.

Panelists discussed the increasing importance of tech-\\nnology as both a vehicle to deliver healthcare and a tool to enhance the quality of care. On the issue of \\ndelivery, various panelists pointed to a number of concerns including access to and expense of broadband \\nservice, the privacy concerns associated with telehealth systems, the expense associated with health \\nmonitoring devices, and how this can exacerbate equity issues.  On the issue of technology enhanced care, \\nsome panelists spoke extensively about the way in which racial biases and the use of race in medicine \\nperpetuate harms and embed prior discrimination, and the importance of ensuring that the technologies used \\nin medical care were accountable to the relevant stakeholders. Various panelists emphasized the importance \\nof having the voices of those subjected to these technologies be heard.\\n59\\n\"),\n",

This framework was \\nreleased one year after OSTP announced the launch of a process to develop “a bill of rights for an AI-powered \\nworld.” Its release follows a year of public engagement to inform this initiative. The framework is available \\nonline at: https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights \\nAbout the Office of Science and Technology Policy \\nThe Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and Technology \\nPolicy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to provide the President and others within the Executive Office \\nof the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national \\nsecurity, health, foreign relations, the environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, among \\nother topics. OSTP leads interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts, assists the Office of \\nManagement and Budget (OMB) with an annual review and analysis of Federal research and development in \\nbudgets, and serves as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with \\nrespect to major policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government. \\nLegal Disclaimer \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights: Making Automated Systems Work for the American People is a white paper \\npublished by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. It is intended to support the \\ndevelopment of policies and practices that protect civil rights and promote democratic values in the building, \\ndeployment, and governance of automated systems. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is non-binding and does not constitute U.S. government policy. It \\ndoes not supersede, modify, or direct an interpretation of any existing statute, regulation, policy, or \\ninternational instrument. It does not constitute binding guidance for the public or Federal agencies and \\ntherefore does not require compliance with the principles described herein. It also is not determinative of what \\nthe U.S. government’s position will be in any international negotiation. Adoption of these principles may not \\nmeet the requirements of existing statutes, regulations, policies, or international instruments, or the \\nrequirements of the Federal agencies that enforce them. These principles are not intended to, and do not, \\nprohibit or limit any lawful activity of a government agency, including law enforcement, national security, or \\nintelligence activities. \\nThe appropriate application of the principles set forth in this white paper depends significantly on the \\ncontext in which automated systems are being utilized. In some circumstances, application of these principles \\nin whole or in part may not be appropriate given the intended use of automated systems to achieve government \\nagency missions. Future sector-specific guidance will likely be necessary and important for guiding the use of \\nautomated systems in certain settings such as AI systems used as part of school building security or automated \\nhealth diagnostic systems. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights recognizes that law enforcement activities require a balancing of \\nequities, for example, between the protection of sensitive law enforcement information and the principle of \\nnotice; as such, notice may not be appropriate, or may need to be adjusted to protect sources, methods, and \\nother law enforcement equities. Even in contexts where these principles may not apply in whole or in part, \\nfederal departments and agencies remain subject to judicial, privacy, and civil liberties oversight as well as \\nexisting policies and safeguards that govern automated systems, including, for example, Executive Order 13960, \\nPromoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government (December 2020). \\nThis white paper recognizes that national security (which includes certain law enforcement and \\nhomeland security activities) and defense activities are of increased sensitivity and interest to our nation’s \\nadversaries and are often subject to special requirements, such as those governing classified information and \\nother protected data. Such activities require alternative, compatible safeguards through existing policies that \\ngovern automated systems and AI, such as the Department of Defense (DOD) AI Ethical Principles and \\nResponsible AI Implementation Pathway and the Intelligence Community (IC) AI Ethics Principles and \\nFramework. The implementation of these policies to national security and defense activities can be informed by \\nthe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights where feasible. \\nThe Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is not intended to, and does not, create any legal right, benefit, or \\ndefense, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its \\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person, nor does it constitute a \\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. \\nCopyright Information \\nThis document is a work of the United States Government and is in the public domain (see 17 U.S.C. §105). \\n2\\n'),\n",

Too often, these tools are used to limit our opportunities and \\nprevent our access to critical resources or services. These problems are well documented. In America and around \\nthe world, systems supposed to help with patient care have proven unsafe, ineffective, or biased. Algorithms used \\nin hiring and credit decisions have been found to reflect and reproduce existing unwanted inequities or embed \\nnew harmful bias and discrimination. Unchecked social media data collection has been used to threaten people’s \\nopportunities, undermine their privacy, or pervasively track their activity—often without their knowledge or \\nconsent. \\nThese outcomes are deeply harmful—but they are not inevitable. Automated systems have brought about extraor-\\ndinary benefits, from technology that helps farmers grow food more efficiently and computers that predict storm \\npaths, to algorithms that can identify diseases in patients. These tools now drive important decisions across \\nsectors, while data is helping to revolutionize global industries. Fueled by the power of American innovation, \\nthese tools hold the potential to redefine every part of our society and make life better for everyone. \\nThis important progress must not come at the price of civil rights or democratic values, foundational American \\nprinciples that President Biden has affirmed as a cornerstone of his Administration. On his first day in office, the \\nPresident ordered the full Federal government to work to root out inequity, embed fairness in decision-\\nmaking processes, and affirmatively advance civil rights, equal opportunity, and racial justice in America.1 The \\nPresident has spoken forcefully about the urgent challenges posed to democracy today and has regularly called \\non people of conscience to act to preserve civil rights—including the right to privacy, which he has called “the \\nbasis for so many more rights that we have come to take for granted that are ingrained in the fabric of this \\ncountry.”2\\nTo advance President Biden’s vision, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has identified \\nfive principles that should guide the design, use, and deployment of automated systems to protect the American \\npublic in the age of artificial intelligence. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is a guide for a society that \\nprotects all people from these threats—and uses technologies in ways that reinforce our highest values. \\nResponding to the experiences of the American public, and informed by insights from researchers, \\ntechnologists, advocates, journalists, and policymakers, this framework is accompanied by a technical \\ncompanion—a handbook for anyone seeking to incorporate these protections into policy and practice, including \\ndetailed steps toward actualizing these principles in the technological design process. These principles help \\nprovide guidance whenever automated systems can meaningfully impact the public’s rights, opportunities, \\nor access to critical needs. \\n3\\n'),\n",

Developed through extensive consultation with the American public, these principles are \\na blueprint for building and deploying automated systems that are aligned with democratic values and protect \\ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights includes this Foreword, the five \\nprinciples, notes on Applying the The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, and a Technical Companion that gives \\nconcrete steps that can be taken by many kinds of organizations—from governments at all levels to companies of \\nall sizes—to uphold these values. Experts from across the private sector, governments, and international \\nconsortia have published principles and frameworks to guide the responsible use of automated systems; this \\nframework provides a national values statement and toolkit that is sector-agnostic to inform building these \\nprotections into policy, practice, or the technological design process.  Where existing law or policy—such as \\nsector-specific privacy laws and oversight requirements—do not already provide guidance, the Blueprint for an \\nAI Bill of Rights should be used to inform policy decisions.\\nLISTENING TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC\\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy has led a year-long process to seek and distill input \\nfrom people across the country—from impacted communities and industry stakeholders to technology develop-\\ners and other experts across fields and sectors, as well as policymakers throughout the Federal government—on \\nthe issue of algorithmic and data-driven harms and potential remedies. Through panel discussions, public listen-\\ning sessions, meetings, a formal request for information, and input to a publicly accessible and widely-publicized \\nemail address, people throughout the United States, public servants across Federal agencies, and members of the \\ninternational community spoke up about both the promises and potential harms of these technologies, and \\nplayed a central role in shaping the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The core messages gleaned from these \\ndiscussions include that AI has transformative potential to improve Americans’ lives, and that preventing the \\nharms of these technologies is both necessary and achievable. The Appendix includes a full list of public engage-\\nments. \\n4\\n'),\n",

Ensuring some of the additional protections proposed in this framework \\nwould require new laws to be enacted or new policies and practices to be adopted. In some cases, exceptions to \\nthe principles described in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights may be necessary to comply with existing law, \\nconform to the practicalities of a specific use case, or balance competing public interests. In particular, law \\nenforcement, and other regulatory contexts may require government actors to protect civil rights, civil liberties, \\nand privacy in a manner consistent with, but using alternate mechanisms to, the specific principles discussed in \\nthis framework. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is meant to assist governments and the private sector in \\nmoving principles into practice. \\nThe expectations given in the Technical Companion are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of \\nadditional technical standards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts. While \\nexisting laws informed the development of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, this framework does not detail \\nthose laws beyond providing them as examples, where appropriate, of existing protective measures. This \\nframework instead shares a broad, forward-leaning vision of recommended principles for automated system \\ndevelopment and use to inform private and public involvement with these systems where they have the poten\\xad\\ntial to meaningfully impact rights, opportunities, or access. Additionally, this framework does not analyze or \\ntake a position on legislative and regulatory proposals in municipal, state, and federal government, or those in \\nother countries. \\nWe have seen modest progress in recent years, with some state and local governments responding to these prob\\xad\\nlems with legislation, and some courts extending longstanding statutory protections to new and emerging tech\\xad\\nnologies. There are companies working to incorporate additional protections in their design and use of auto\\xad\\nmated systems, and researchers developing innovative guardrails. Advocates, researchers, and government \\norganizations have proposed principles for the ethical use of AI and other automated systems. These include \\nthe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD’s) 2019 Recommendation on Artificial \\nIntelligence, which includes principles for responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI and which the United \\nStates adopted, and Executive Order 13960 on Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the \\nFederal Government, which sets out principles that govern the federal government’s use of AI. The Blueprint \\nfor an AI Bill of Rights is fully consistent with these principles and with the direction in Executive Order 13985 \\non Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government. \\nThese principles find kinship in the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs), derived from the 1973 report \\nof an advisory committee to the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Records, Computers, \\nand the Rights of Citizens.4 While there is no single, universal articulation of the FIPPs, these core \\nprinciples for managing information about individuals have been incorporated into data privacy laws and \\npolicies across the globe.5 The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights embraces elements of the FIPPs that are \\nparticularly relevant to automated systems, without articulating a specific set of FIPPs or scoping \\napplicability or the interests served to a single particular domain, like privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, \\nethics, or risk management. The Technical Companion builds on this prior work to provide practical next \\nsteps to move these principles into practice and promote common approaches that allow technological \\ninnovation to flourish while protecting people from harm. \\n9\\n'),\n",

Depending on the specific circumstances, such algorithmic discrimination may violate \\nlegal protections. Throughout this framework the term “algorithmic discrimination” takes this meaning (and \\nnot a technical understanding of discrimination as distinguishing between items). \\nAUTOMATED SYSTEM: An \"automated system\" is any system, software, or process that uses computation as \\nwhole or part of a system to determine outcomes, make or aid decisions, inform policy implementation, collect \\ndata or observations, or otherwise interact with individuals and/or communities. Automated systems \\ninclude, but are not limited to, systems derived from machine learning, statistics, or other data processing \\nor artificial intelligence techniques, and exclude passive computing infrastructure. “Passive computing \\ninfrastructure” is any intermediary technology that does not influence or determine the outcome of decision, \\nmake or aid in decisions, inform policy implementation, or collect data or observations, including web \\nhosting, domain registration, networking, caching, data storage, or cybersecurity. Throughout this \\nframework, automated systems that are considered in scope are only those that have the potential to \\nmeaningfully impact individuals’ or communi-ties’ rights, opportunities, or access. \\nCOMMUNITIES: “Communities” include: neighborhoods; social network connections (both online and \\noffline); families (construed broadly); people connected by affinity, identity, or shared traits; and formal organi-\\nzational ties. This includes Tribes, Clans, Bands, Rancherias, Villages, and other Indigenous communities. AI \\nand other data-driven automated systems most directly collect data on, make inferences about, and may cause \\nharm to individuals. But the overall magnitude of their impacts may be most readily visible at the level of com-\\nmunities. Accordingly, the concept of community is integral to the scope of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. \\nUnited States law and policy have long employed approaches for protecting the rights of individuals, but exist-\\ning frameworks have sometimes struggled to provide protections when effects manifest most clearly at a com-\\nmunity level. For these reasons, the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights asserts that the harms of automated \\nsystems should be evaluated, protected against, and redressed at both the individual and community levels. \\nEQUITY: “Equity” means the consistent and systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals. \\nSystemic, fair, and just treatment must take into account the status of individuals who belong to underserved \\ncommunities that have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American \\npersons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; \\nwomen, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) \\npersons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely \\naffected by persistent poverty or inequality. \\nRIGHTS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR ACCESS: “Rights, opportunities, or access” is used to indicate the scoping \\nof this framework. It describes the set of: civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy, including freedom of speech, \\nvoting, and protections from discrimination, excessive punishment, unlawful surveillance, and violations of \\nprivacy and other freedoms in both public and private sector contexts; equal opportunities, including equitable \\naccess to education, housing, credit, employment, and other programs; or, access to critical resources or \\nservices, such as healthcare, financial services, safety, social services, non-deceptive information about goods \\nand services, and government benefits. \\n10\\n'),\n",

Data and metadata generated by or about \\nthose who are not yet legal adults is also sensitive, even if not related to a sensitive domain. Such data includes, \\nbut is not limited to, numerical, text, image, audio, or video data. \\nSENSITIVE DOMAINS: “Sensitive domains” are those in which activities being conducted can cause material \\nharms, including significant adverse effects on human rights such as autonomy and dignity, as well as civil liber\\xad\\nties and civil rights. Domains that have historically been singled out as deserving of enhanced data protections \\nor where such enhanced protections are reasonably expected by the public include, but are not limited to, \\nhealth, family planning and care, employment, education, criminal justice, and personal finance.

This technical companion considers each principle in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and \\nprovides examples and concrete steps for communities, industry, governments, and others to take in order to \\nbuild these protections into policy, practice, or the technological design process. \\nTaken together, the technical protections and practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights can help \\nguard the American public against many of the potential and actual harms identified by researchers, technolo\\xad\\ngists, advocates, journalists, policymakers, and communities in the United States and around the world. This \\ntechnical companion is intended to be used as a reference by people across many circumstances – anyone \\nimpacted by automated systems, and anyone developing, designing, deploying, evaluating, or making policy to \\ngovern the use of an automated system. \\nEach principle is accompanied by three supplemental sections: \\n1\\n2\\nWHY THIS PRINCIPLE IS IMPORTANT: \\nThis section provides a brief summary of the problems that the principle seeks to address and protect against, including \\nillustrative examples. \\nWHAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED OF AUTOMATED SYSTEMS: \\n• The expectations for automated systems are meant to serve as a blueprint for the development of additional technical\\nstandards and practices that should be tailored for particular sectors and contexts.\\n• This section outlines practical steps that can be implemented to realize the vision of the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. The \\nexpectations laid out often mirror existing practices for technology development, including pre-deployment testing, ongoing \\nmonitoring, and governance structures for automated systems, but also go further to address unmet needs for change and offer \\nconcrete directions for how those changes can be made. \\n• Expectations about reporting are intended for the entity developing or using the automated system. The resulting reports can \\nbe provided to the public, regulators, auditors, industry standards groups, or others engaged in independent review, and should \\nbe made public as much as possible consistent with law, regulation, and policy, and noting that intellectual property, law \\nenforcement, or national security considerations may prevent public release. Where public reports are not possible, the \\ninformation should be provided to oversight bodies and privacy, civil liberties, or other ethics officers charged with safeguard \\ning individuals’ rights. These reporting expectations are important for transparency, so the American people can have\\nconfidence that their rights, opportunities, and access as well as their expectations about technologies are respected. \\n3\\nHOW THESE PRINCIPLES CAN MOVE INTO PRACTICE: \\nThis section provides real-life examples of how these guiding principles can become reality, through laws, policies, and practices. \\nIt describes practical technical and sociotechnical approaches to protecting rights, opportunities, and access. \\nThe examples provided are not critiques or endorsements, but rather are offered as illustrative cases to help \\nprovide a concrete vision for actualizing the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Effectively implementing these \\nprocesses require the cooperation of and collaboration among industry, civil society, researchers, policymakers, \\ntechnologists, and the public. \\n14\\n'),\n",

In other cases, technologies do not work as intended or as promised, causing substantial and unjustified harm. \\nAutomated systems sometimes rely on data from other systems, including historical data, allowing irrelevant informa\\xad\\ntion from past decisions to infect decision-making in unrelated situations.  In some cases, technologies are purposeful\\xad\\nly designed to violate the safety of others, such as technologies designed to facilitate stalking; in other cases, intended \\nor unintended uses lead to unintended harms. \\nMany of the harms resulting from these technologies are preventable, and actions are already being taken to protect \\nthe public. Some companies have put in place safeguards that have prevented harm from occurring by ensuring that \\nkey development decisions are vetted by an ethics review; others have identified and mitigated harms found through \\npre-deployment testing and ongoing monitoring processes. Governments at all levels have existing public consulta\\xad\\ntion processes that may be applied when considering the use of new automated systems, and existing product develop\\xad\\nment and testing practices already protect the American public from many potential harms. \\nStill, these kinds of practices are deployed too rarely and unevenly. Expanded, proactive protections could build on \\nthese existing practices, increase confidence in the use of automated systems, and protect the American public. Inno\\xad\\nvators deserve clear rules of the road that allow new ideas to flourish, and the American public deserves protections \\nfrom unsafe outcomes. All can benefit from assurances that automated systems will be designed, tested, and consis\\xad\\ntently confirmed to work as intended, and that they will be proactively protected from foreseeable unintended harm\\xad\\nful outcomes. \\n•\\nA proprietary model was developed to predict the likelihood of sepsis in hospitalized patients and was imple\\xad\\nmented at hundreds of hospitals around the country.

These expectations are explained below. \\nProtect the public from harm in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nConsultation. The public should be consulted in the design, implementation, deployment, acquisition, and \\nmaintenance phases of automated system development, with emphasis on early-stage consultation before a \\nsystem is introduced or a large change implemented. This consultation should directly engage diverse impact\\xad\\ned communities to consider concerns and risks that may be unique to those communities, or disproportionate\\xad\\nly prevalent or severe for them. The extent of this engagement and the form of outreach to relevant stakehold\\xad\\ners may differ depending on the specific automated system and development phase, but should include \\nsubject matter, sector-specific, and context-specific experts as well as experts on potential impacts such as \\ncivil rights, civil liberties, and privacy experts. For private sector applications, consultations before product \\nlaunch may need to be confidential. Government applications, particularly law enforcement applications or \\napplications that raise national security considerations, may require confidential or limited engagement based \\non system sensitivities and preexisting oversight laws and structures. Concerns raised in this consultation \\nshould be documented, and the automated system developers were proposing to create, use, or deploy should \\nbe reconsidered based on this feedback. \\nTesting. Systems should undergo extensive testing before deployment. This testing should follow \\ndomain-specific best practices, when available, for ensuring the technology will work in its real-world \\ncontext. Such testing should take into account both the specific technology used and the roles of any human \\noperators or reviewers who impact system outcomes or effectiveness; testing should include both automated \\nsystems testing and human-led (manual) testing. Testing conditions should mirror as closely as possible the \\nconditions in which the system will be deployed, and new testing may be required for each deployment to \\naccount for material differences in conditions from one deployment to another. Following testing, system \\nperformance should be compared with the in-place, potentially human-driven, status quo procedures, with \\nexisting human performance considered as a performance baseline for the algorithm to meet pre-deployment, \\nand as a lifecycle minimum performance standard. Decision possibilities resulting from performance testing \\nshould include the possibility of not deploying the system. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Before deployment, and in a proactive and ongoing manner, poten\\xad\\ntial risks of the automated system should be identified and mitigated. Identified risks should focus on the \\npotential for meaningful impact on people’s rights, opportunities, or access and include those to impacted \\ncommunities that may not be direct users of the automated system, risks resulting from purposeful misuse of \\nthe system, and other concerns identified via the consultation process. Assessment and, where possible, mea\\xad\\nsurement of the impact of risks should be included and balanced such that high impact risks receive attention \\nand mitigation proportionate with those impacts. Automated systems with the intended purpose of violating \\nthe safety of others should not be developed or used; systems with such safety violations as identified unin\\xad\\ntended consequences should not be used until the risk can be mitigated. Ongoing risk mitigation may necessi\\xad\\ntate rollback or significant modification to a launched automated system. \\n18\\n'),\n",

This ongoing monitoring should include continuous evaluation of performance metrics and \\nharm assessments, updates of any systems, and retraining of any machine learning models as necessary, as well \\nas ensuring that fallback mechanisms are in place to allow reversion to a previously working system.

Ongoing monitoring procedures should include manual, human-led monitor\\xad\\ning as a check in the event there are shortcomings in automated monitoring systems. These monitoring proce\\xad\\ndures should be in place for the lifespan of the deployed automated system. \\nClear organizational oversight.

These principles—while taking into account the sensitive law enforcement and other contexts in which \\nthe federal government may use AI, as opposed to private sector use of AI—require that AI is: (a) lawful and \\nrespectful of our Nation’s values; (b) purposeful and performance-driven; (c) accurate, reliable, and effective; (d) \\nsafe, secure, and resilient; (e) understandable; (f ) responsible and traceable; (g) regularly monitored; (h) transpar-\\nent; and, (i) accountable.

Cars, like automated digital systems, comprise a complex collection of components. \\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,14 through its rigorous standards and independent \\nevaluation, helps make sure vehicles on our roads are safe without limiting manufacturers’ ability to \\ninnovate.15 At the same time, rules of the road are implemented locally to impose contextually appropriate \\nrequirements on drivers, such as slowing down near schools or playgrounds.16\\nFrom large companies to start-ups, industry is providing innovative solutions that allow \\norganizations to mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of AI systems, both before \\ndeployment and through monitoring over time.17 These innovative solutions include risk \\nassessments, auditing mechanisms, assessment of organizational procedures, dashboards to allow for ongoing \\nmonitoring, documentation procedures specific to model assessments, and many other strategies that aim to \\nmitigate risks posed by the use of AI to companies’ reputation, legal responsibilities, and other product safety \\nand effectiveness concerns. \\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has called for an expansion of opportunities \\nfor meaningful stakeholder engagement in the design of programs and services. OMB also \\npoints to numerous examples of effective and proactive stakeholder engagement, including the Community-\\nBased Participatory Research Program developed by the National Institutes of Health and the participatory \\ntechnology assessments developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.18\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing a risk \\nmanagement framework to better manage risks posed to individuals, organizations, and \\nsociety by AI.19 The NIST AI Risk Management Framework, as mandated by Congress, is intended for \\nvoluntary use to help incorporate trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and \\nevaluation of AI products, services, and systems. The NIST framework is being developed through a consensus-\\ndriven, open, transparent, and collaborative process that includes workshops and other opportunities to provide \\ninput. The NIST framework aims to foster the development of innovative approaches to address \\ncharacteristics of trustworthiness including accuracy, explainability and interpretability, reliability, privacy, \\nrobustness, safety, security (resilience), and mitigation of unintended and/or harmful bias, as well as of \\nharmful \\nuses. \\nThe \\nNIST \\nframework \\nwill \\nconsider \\nand \\nencompass \\nprinciples \\nsuch \\nas \\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness during pre-design, design and development, deployment, use, \\nand testing and evaluation of AI technologies and systems.

For example, facial recognition technology that can contribute to wrongful and discriminatory \\narrests,31 hiring algorithms that inform discriminatory decisions, and healthcare algorithms that discount \\nthe severity of certain diseases in Black Americans. Instances of discriminatory practices built into and \\nresulting from AI and other automated systems exist across many industries, areas, and contexts. While automated \\nsystems have the capacity to drive extraordinary advances and innovations, algorithmic discrimination \\nprotections should be built into their design, deployment, and ongoing use. \\nMany companies, non-profits, and federal government agencies are already taking steps to ensure the public \\nis protected from algorithmic discrimination. Some companies have instituted bias testing as part of their product \\nquality assessment and launch procedures, and in some cases this testing has led products to be changed or not \\nlaunched, preventing harm to the public. Federal government agencies have been developing standards and guidance \\nfor the use of automated systems in order to help prevent bias. Non-profits and companies have developed best \\npractices for audits and impact assessments to help identify potential algorithmic discrimination and provide \\ntransparency to the public in the mitigation of such biases. \\nBut there is much more work to do to protect the public from algorithmic discrimination to use and design \\nautomated systems in an equitable way. The guardrails protecting the public from discrimination in their daily \\nlives should include their digital lives and impacts—basic safeguards against abuse, bias, and discrimination to \\nensure that all people are treated fairly when automated systems are used. This includes all dimensions of their \\nlives, from hiring to loan approvals, from medical treatment and payment to encounters with the criminal \\njustice system. Ensuring equity should also go beyond existing guardrails to consider the holistic impact that \\nautomated systems make on underserved communities and to institute proactive protections that support these \\ncommunities. \\n•\\nAn automated system using nontraditional factors such as educational attainment and employment history as\\npart of its loan underwriting and pricing model was found to be much more likely to charge an applicant who\\nattended a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) higher loan prices for refinancing a student loan\\nthan an applicant who did not attend an HBCU. This was found to be true even when controlling for\\nother credit-related factors.32\\n•\\nA hiring tool that learned the features of a company's employees (predominantly men) rejected women appli\\xad\\ncants for spurious and discriminatory reasons; resumes with the word “women’s,” such as “women’s\\nchess club captain,” were penalized in the candidate ranking.33\\n•\\nA predictive model marketed as being able to predict whether students are likely to drop out of school was\\nused by more than 500 universities across the country. The model was found to use race directly as a predictor,\\nand also shown to have large disparities by race; Black students were as many as four times as likely as their\\notherwise similar white peers to be deemed at high risk of dropping out. These risk scores are used by advisors \\nto guide students towards or away from majors, and some worry that they are being used to guide\\nBlack students away from math and science subjects.34\\n•\\nA risk assessment tool designed to predict the risk of recidivism for individuals in federal custody showed\\nevidence of disparity in prediction. The tool overpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on the\\ngeneral recidivism tools, and underpredicts the risk of recidivism for some groups of color on some of the\\nviolent recidivism tools. The Department of Justice is working to reduce these disparities and has\\npublicly released a report detailing its review of the tool.35 \\n24\\n\"),\n",

Some algorithmic discrimination is already prohibited under existing anti-discrimination law. The \\nexpectations set out below describe proactive technical and policy steps that can be taken to not only \\nreinforce those legal protections but extend beyond them to ensure equity for underserved communities48 \\neven in circumstances where a specific legal protection may not be clearly established. These protections \\nshould be instituted throughout the design, development, and deployment process and are described below \\nroughly in the order in which they would be instituted. \\nProtect the public from algorithmic discrimination in a proactive and ongoing manner \\nProactive assessment of equity in design. Those responsible for the development, use, or oversight of \\nautomated systems should conduct proactive equity assessments in the design phase of the technology \\nresearch and development or during its acquisition to review potential input data, associated historical \\ncontext, accessibility for people with disabilities, and societal goals to identify potential discrimination and \\neffects on equity resulting from the introduction of the technology. The assessed groups should be as inclusive \\nas possible of the underserved communities mentioned in the equity definition:  Black, Latino, and Indigenous \\nand Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; members of \\nreligious minorities; women, girls, and non-binary people; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and inter-\\nsex (LGBTQI+) persons; older adults; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons \\notherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. Assessment could include both qualitative \\nand quantitative evaluations of the system. This equity assessment should also be considered a core part of the \\ngoals of the consultation conducted as part of the safety and efficacy review. \\nRepresentative and robust data. Any data used as part of system development or assessment should be \\nrepresentative of local communities based on the planned deployment setting and should be reviewed for bias \\nbased on the historical and societal context of the data. Such data should be sufficiently robust to identify and \\nhelp to mitigate biases and potential harms. \\nGuarding against proxies.  Directly using demographic information in the design, development, or \\ndeployment of an automated system (for purposes other than evaluating a system for discrimination or using \\na system to counter discrimination) runs a high risk of leading to algorithmic discrimination and should be \\navoided. In many cases, attributes that are highly correlated with demographic features, known as proxies, can \\ncontribute to algorithmic discrimination. In cases where use of the demographic features themselves would \\nlead to illegal algorithmic discrimination, reliance on such proxies in decision-making (such as that facilitated \\nby an algorithm) may also be prohibited by law. Proactive testing should be performed to identify proxies by \\ntesting for correlation between demographic information and attributes in any data used as part of system \\ndesign, development, or use. If a proxy is identified, designers, developers, and deployers should remove the \\nproxy; if needed, it may be possible to identify alternative attributes that can be used instead. At a minimum, \\norganizations should ensure a proxy feature is not given undue weight and should monitor the system closely \\nfor any resulting algorithmic discrimination.   \\n26\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n'),\n",

Systems should be \\ndesigned, developed, and deployed by organizations in ways that ensure accessibility to people with disabili\\xad\\nties. This should include consideration of a wide variety of disabilities, adherence to relevant accessibility \\nstandards, and user experience research both before and after deployment to identify and address any accessi\\xad\\nbility barriers to the use or effectiveness of the automated system. \\nDisparity assessment. Automated systems should be tested using a broad set of measures to assess wheth\\xad\\ner the system components, both in pre-deployment testing and in-context deployment, produce disparities. \\nThe demographics of the assessed groups should be as inclusive as possible of race, color, ethnicity, sex \\n(including pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions, gender identity, intersex status, and sexual \\norientation), religion, age, national origin, disability, veteran status, genetic information, or any other classifi\\xad\\ncation protected by law. The broad set of measures assessed should include demographic performance mea\\xad\\nsures, overall and subgroup parity assessment, and calibration. Demographic data collected for disparity \\nassessment should be separated from data used for the automated system and privacy protections should be \\ninstituted; in some cases it may make sense to perform such assessment using a data sample. For every \\ninstance where the deployed automated system leads to different treatment or impacts disfavoring the identi\\xad\\nfied groups, the entity governing, implementing, or using the system should document the disparity and a \\njustification for any continued use of the system. \\nDisparity mitigation. When a disparity assessment identifies a disparity against an assessed group, it may \\nbe appropriate to take steps to mitigate or eliminate the disparity. In some cases, mitigation or elimination of \\nthe disparity may be required by law. \\nDisparities that have the potential to lead to algorithmic \\ndiscrimination, cause meaningful harm, or violate equity49 goals should be mitigated. When designing and \\nevaluating an automated system, steps should be taken to evaluate multiple models and select the one that \\nhas the least adverse impact, modify data input choices, or otherwise identify a system with fewer \\ndisparities. If adequate mitigation of the disparity is not possible, then the use of the automated system \\nshould be reconsidered. One of the considerations in whether to use the system should be the validity of any \\ntarget measure; unobservable targets may result in the inappropriate use of proxies. Meeting these \\nstandards may require instituting mitigation procedures and other protective measures to address \\nalgorithmic discrimination, avoid meaningful harm, and achieve equity goals. \\nOngoing monitoring and mitigation. Automated systems should be regularly monitored to assess algo\\xad\\nrithmic discrimination that might arise from unforeseen interactions of the system with inequities not \\naccounted for during the pre-deployment testing, changes to the system after deployment, or changes to the \\ncontext of use or associated data. Monitoring and disparity assessment should be performed by the entity \\ndeploying or using the automated system to examine whether the system has led to algorithmic discrimina\\xad\\ntion when deployed. This assessment should be performed regularly and whenever a pattern of unusual \\nresults is occurring. It can be performed using a variety of approaches, taking into account whether and how \\ndemographic information of impacted people is available, for example via testing with a sample of users or via \\nqualitative user experience research. Riskier and higher-impact systems should be monitored and assessed \\nmore frequently. Outcomes of this assessment should include additional disparity mitigation, if needed, or \\nfallback to earlier procedures in the case that equity standards are no longer met and can't be mitigated, and \\nprior mechanisms provide better adherence to equity standards. \\n27\\nAlgorithmic \\nDiscrimination \\nProtections \\n\"),\n",

The Action Plan to Advance Property Appraisal and Valuation \\nEquity includes a commitment from the agencies that oversee mortgage lending to include a \\nnondiscrimination standard in the proposed rules for Automated Valuation Models.52\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Justice have clearly \\nlaid out how employers’ use of AI and other automated systems can result in \\ndiscrimination against job applicants and employees with disabilities.53 The documents explain \\nhow employers’ use of software that relies on algorithmic decision-making may violate existing requirements \\nunder Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). This technical assistance also provides practical \\ntips to employers on how to comply with the ADA, and to job applicants and employees who think that their \\nrights may have been violated. \\nDisparity assessments identified harms to Black patients' healthcare access. A widely \\nused healthcare algorithm relied on the cost of each patient’s past medical care to predict future medical needs, \\nrecommending early interventions for the patients deemed most at risk. This process discriminated \\nagainst Black patients, who generally have less access to medical care and therefore have generated less cost \\nthan white patients with similar illness and need. A landmark study documented this pattern and proposed \\npractical ways that were shown to reduce this bias, such as focusing specifically on active chronic health \\nconditions or avoidable future costs related to emergency visits and hospitalization.54 \\nLarge employers have developed best practices to scrutinize the data and models used \\nfor hiring. An industry initiative has developed Algorithmic Bias Safeguards for the Workforce, a structured \\nquestionnaire that businesses can use proactively when procuring software to evaluate workers.

Surveil\\xad\\nlance and data collection, sharing, use, and reuse now sit at the foundation of business models across many industries, \\nwith more and more companies tracking the behavior of the American public, building individual profiles based on \\nthis data, and using this granular-level information as input into automated systems that further track, profile, and \\nimpact the American public. Government agencies, particularly law enforcement agencies, also use and help develop \\na variety of technologies that enhance and expand surveillance capabilities, which similarly collect data used as input \\ninto other automated systems that directly impact people’s lives. Federal law has not grown to address the expanding \\nscale of private data collection, or of the ability of governments at all levels to access that data and leverage the means \\nof private collection.  \\nMeanwhile, members of the American public are often unable to access their personal data or make critical decisions \\nabout its collection and use. Data brokers frequently collect consumer data from numerous sources without \\nconsumers’ permission or knowledge.60 Moreover, there is a risk that inaccurate and faulty data can be used to \\nmake decisions about their lives, such as whether they will qualify for a loan or get a job. Use of surveillance \\ntechnologies has increased in schools and workplaces, and, when coupled with consequential management and \\nevaluation decisions, it is leading to mental health harms such as lowered self-confidence, anxiety, depression, and \\na reduced ability to use analytical reasoning.61 Documented patterns show that personal data is being aggregated by \\ndata brokers to profile communities in harmful ways.62 The impact of all this data harvesting is corrosive, \\nbreeding distrust, anxiety, and other mental health problems; chilling speech, protest, and worker organizing; and \\nthreatening our democratic process.63 The American public should be protected from these growing risks. \\nIncreasingly, some companies are taking these concerns seriously and integrating mechanisms to protect consumer \\nprivacy into their products by design and by default, including by minimizing the data they collect, communicating \\ncollection and use clearly, and improving security practices. Federal government surveillance and other collection and \\nuse of data is governed by legal protections that help to protect civil liberties and provide for limits on data retention \\nin some cases. Many states have also enacted consumer data privacy protection regimes to address some of these \\nharms. \\nHowever, these are not yet standard practices, and the United States lacks a comprehensive statutory or regulatory \\nframework governing the rights of the public when it comes to personal data. While a patchwork of laws exists to \\nguide the collection and use of personal data in specific contexts, including health, employment, education, and credit, \\nit can be unclear how these laws apply in other contexts and in an increasingly automated society. Additional protec\\xad\\ntions would assure the American public that the automated systems they use are not monitoring their activities, \\ncollecting information on their lives, or otherwise surveilling them without context-specific consent or legal authori\\xad\\nty. \\n31\\n'),\n",

Any automated system collecting, using, sharing, or storing personal data \\nshould meet these expectations. \\nProtect privacy by design and by default \\nPrivacy by design and by default. Automated systems should be designed and built with privacy protect\\xad\\ned by default. Privacy risks should be assessed throughout the development life cycle, including privacy risks \\nfrom reidentification, and appropriate technical and policy mitigation measures should be implemented. This \\nincludes potential harms to those who are not users of the automated system, but who may be harmed by \\ninferred data, purposeful privacy violations, or community surveillance or other community harms. Data \\ncollection should be minimized and clearly communicated to the people whose data is collected. Data should \\nonly be collected or used for the purposes of training or testing machine learning models if such collection and \\nuse is legal and consistent with the expectations of the people whose data is collected. User experience \\nresearch should be conducted to confirm that people understand what data is being collected about them and \\nhow it will be used, and that this collection matches their expectations and desires. \\nData collection and use-case scope limits. Data collection should be limited in scope, with specific, \\nnarrow identified goals, to avoid \"mission creep.\"  Anticipated data collection should be determined to be \\nstrictly necessary to the identified goals and should be minimized as much as possible. Data collected based on \\nthese identified goals and for a specific context should not be used in a different context without assessing for \\nnew privacy risks and implementing appropriate mitigation measures, which may include express consent. \\nClear timelines for data retention should be established, with data deleted as soon as possible in accordance \\nwith legal or policy-based limitations. Determined data retention timelines should be documented and justi\\xad\\nfied. \\nRisk identification and mitigation. Entities that collect, use, share, or store sensitive data should \\nattempt to proactively identify harms and seek to manage them so as to avoid, mitigate, and respond appropri\\xad\\nately to identified risks. Appropriate responses include determining not to process data when the privacy risks \\noutweigh the benefits or implementing measures to mitigate acceptable risks. Appropriate responses do not \\ninclude sharing or transferring the privacy risks to users via notice or consent requests where users could not \\nreasonably be expected to understand the risks without further support. \\nPrivacy-preserving security.

This assessment should be done before deployment and should give special attention to ensure \\nthere is not algorithmic discrimination, especially based on community membership, when deployed in a \\nspecific real-world context. Such assessment should then be reaffirmed in an ongoing manner as long as the \\nsystem is in use. \\nLimited and proportionate surveillance. Surveillance should be avoided unless it is strictly necessary \\nto achieve a legitimate purpose and it is proportionate to the need. Designers, developers, and deployers of \\nsurveillance systems should use the least invasive means of monitoring available and restrict monitoring to the \\nminimum number of subjects possible. To the greatest extent possible consistent with law enforcement and \\nnational security needs, individuals subject to monitoring should be provided with clear and specific notice \\nbefore it occurs and be informed about how the data gathered through surveillance will be used. \\nScope limits on surveillance to protect rights and democratic values. Civil liberties and civil \\nrights must not be limited by the threat of surveillance or harassment facilitated or aided by an automated \\nsystem. Surveillance systems should not be used to monitor the exercise of democratic rights, such as voting, \\nprivacy, peaceful assembly, speech, or association, in a way that limits the exercise of civil rights or civil liber\\xad\\nties. Information about or algorithmically-determined assumptions related to identity should be carefully \\nlimited if used to target or guide surveillance systems in order to avoid algorithmic discrimination; such iden\\xad\\ntity-related information includes group characteristics or affiliations, geographic designations, location-based \\nand association-based inferences, social networks, and biometrics. Continuous surveillance and monitoring \\nsystems should not be used in physical or digital workplaces (regardless of employment status), public educa\\xad\\ntional institutions, and public accommodations. Continuous surveillance and monitoring systems should not \\nbe used in a way that has the effect of limiting access to critical resources or services or suppressing the exer\\xad\\ncise of rights, even where the organization is not under a particular duty to protect those rights. \\nProvide the public with mechanisms for appropriate and meaningful consent, access, and \\ncontrol over their data \\nUse-specific consent. Consent practices should not allow for abusive surveillance practices. Where data \\ncollectors or automated systems seek consent, they should seek it for specific, narrow use contexts, for specif\\xad\\nic time durations, and for use by specific entities. Consent should not extend if any of these conditions change; \\nconsent should be re-acquired before using data if the use case changes, a time limit elapses, or data is trans\\xad\\nferred to another entity (including being shared or sold). Consent requested should be limited in scope and \\nshould not request consent beyond what is required. Refusal to provide consent should be allowed, without \\nadverse effects, to the greatest extent possible based on the needs of the use case. \\nBrief and direct consent requests. When seeking consent from users short, plain language consent \\nrequests should be used so that users understand for what use contexts, time span, and entities they are \\nproviding data and metadata consent.

This includes ensuring that consent \\nrequests are accessible to users with disabilities and are available in the language(s) and reading level appro\\xad\\npriate for the audience.

In some cases, this ethical review may determine that data \\nshould not be used or shared for specific uses even with consent.

Among other things, the Privacy Act limits the storage of individual \\ninformation in federal systems of records, illustrating the principle of limiting the scope of data retention. Under \\nthe Privacy Act, federal agencies may only retain data about an individual that is “relevant and necessary” to \\naccomplish an agency’s statutory purpose or to comply with an Executive Order of the President. The law allows \\nfor individuals to be able to access any of their individual information stored in a federal system of records, if not \\nincluded under one of the systems of records exempted pursuant to the Privacy Act. In these cases, federal agen\\xad\\ncies must provide a method for an individual to determine if their personal information is stored in a particular \\nsystem of records, and must provide procedures for an individual to contest the contents of a record about them. \\nFurther, the Privacy Act allows for a cause of action for an individual to seek legal relief if a federal agency does not \\ncomply with the Privacy Act’s requirements. Among other things, a court may order a federal agency to amend or \\ncorrect an individual’s information in its records or award monetary damages if an inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, \\nor incomplete record results in an adverse determination about an individual’s “qualifications, character, rights, … \\nopportunities…, or benefits.” \\nNIST’s Privacy Framework provides a comprehensive, detailed and actionable approach for \\norganizations to manage privacy risks. The NIST Framework gives organizations ways to identify and \\ncommunicate their privacy risks and goals to support ethical decision-making in system, product, and service \\ndesign or deployment, as well as the measures they are taking to demonstrate compliance with applicable laws \\nor regulations. It has been voluntarily adopted by organizations across many different sectors around the world.78\\nA school board’s attempt to surveil public school students—undertaken without \\nadequate community input—sparked a state-wide biometrics moratorium.79 Reacting to a plan in \\nthe city of Lockport, New York, the state’s legislature banned the use of facial recognition systems and other \\n“biometric identifying technology” in schools until July 1, 2022.80 The law additionally requires that a report on \\nthe privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties implications of the use of such technologies be issued before \\nbiometric identification technologies can be used in New York schools. \\nFederal law requires employers, and any consultants they may retain, to report the costs \\nof surveilling employees in the context of a labor dispute, providing a transparency \\nmechanism to help protect worker organizing. Employers engaging in workplace surveillance \"where \\nan object there-of, directly or indirectly, is […] to obtain information concerning the activities of employees or a \\nlabor organization in connection with a labor dispute\" must report expenditures relating to this surveillance to \\nthe Department of Labor Office of Labor-Management Standards, and consultants who employers retain for \\nthese purposes must also file reports regarding their activities.81\\nPrivacy choices on smartphones show that when technologies are well designed, privacy \\nand data agency can be meaningful and not overwhelming. These choices—such as contextual, timely \\nalerts about location tracking—are brief, direct, and use-specific. Many of the expectations listed here for \\nprivacy by design and use-specific consent mirror those distributed to developers as best practices when \\ndeveloping for smart phone devices,82 such as being transparent about how user data will be used, asking for app \\npermissions during their use so that the use-context will be clear to users, and ensuring that the app will still \\nwork if users deny (or later revoke) some permissions. \\n39\\n'),\n",

But this \\nexpansive impact is not always visible. An applicant might not know whether a person rejected their resume or a \\nhiring algorithm moved them to the bottom of the list. A defendant in the courtroom might not know if a judge deny\\xad\\ning their bail is informed by an automated system that labeled them “high risk.” From correcting errors to contesting \\ndecisions, people are often denied the knowledge they need to address the impact of automated systems on their lives. \\nNotice and explanations also serve an important safety and efficacy purpose, allowing experts to verify the reasonable\\xad\\nness of a recommendation before enacting it. \\nIn order to guard against potential harms, the American public needs to know if an automated system is being used. \\nClear, brief, and understandable notice is a prerequisite for achieving the other protections in this framework. Like\\xad\\nwise, the public is often unable to ascertain how or why an automated system has made a decision or contributed to a \\nparticular outcome. The decision-making processes of automated systems tend to be opaque, complex, and, therefore, \\nunaccountable, whether by design or by omission. These factors can make explanations both more challenging and \\nmore important, and should not be used as a pretext to avoid explaining important decisions to the people impacted \\nby those choices. In the context of automated systems, clear and valid explanations should be recognized as a baseline \\nrequirement. \\nProviding notice has long been a standard practice, and in many cases is a legal requirement, when, for example, \\nmaking a video recording of someone (outside of a law enforcement or national security context). In some cases, such \\nas credit, lenders are required to provide notice and explanation to consumers. Techniques used to automate the \\nprocess of explaining such systems are under active research and improvement and such explanations can take many \\nforms. Innovative companies and researchers are rising to the challenge and creating and deploying explanatory \\nsystems that can help the public better understand decisions that impact them. \\nWhile notice and explanation requirements are already in place in some sectors or situations, the American public \\ndeserve to know consistently and across sectors if an automated system is being used in a way that impacts their rights, \\nopportunities, or access. This knowledge should provide confidence in how the public is being treated, and trust in the \\nvalidity and reasonable use of automated systems. \\n•\\nA lawyer representing an older client with disabilities who had been cut off from Medicaid-funded home\\nhealth-care assistance couldn't determine why, especially since the decision went against historical access\\npractices.

Included among them is a provision that no private \\nentity may \"collect, capture, purchase, receive through trade, or otherwise obtain\" such information about an \\nindividual, unless written notice is provided to that individual or their legally appointed representative. 87\\nMajor technology companies are piloting new ways to communicate with the public about \\ntheir automated technologies. For example, a collection of non-profit organizations and companies have \\nworked together to develop a framework that defines operational approaches to transparency for machine \\nlearning systems.88 This framework, and others like it,89 inform the public about the use of these tools, going \\nbeyond simple notice to include reporting elements such as safety evaluations, disparity assessments, and \\nexplanations of how the systems work. \\nLenders are required by federal law to notify consumers about certain decisions made about \\nthem. Both the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act require in certain circumstances \\nthat consumers who are denied credit receive \"adverse action\" notices. Anyone who relies on the information in a \\ncredit report to deny a consumer credit must, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, provide an \"adverse action\" \\nnotice to the consumer, which includes \"notice of the reasons a creditor took adverse action on the application \\nor on an existing credit account.\"90 In addition, under the risk-based pricing rule,91 lenders must either inform \\nborrowers of their credit score, or else tell consumers when \"they are getting worse terms because of \\ninformation in their credit report.\" The CFPB has also asserted that \"[t]he law gives every applicant the right to \\na specific explanation if their application for credit was denied, and that right is not diminished simply because \\na company uses a complex algorithm that it doesn\\'t understand.\"92 Such explanations illustrate a shared value \\nthat certain decisions need to be explained. \\nA California law requires that warehouse employees are provided with notice and explana-\\ntion about quotas, potentially facilitated by automated systems, that apply to them.

Yet members of the public are often \\npresented with no alternative, or are forced to endure a cumbersome process to reach a human decision-maker once \\nthey decide they no longer want to deal exclusively with the automated system or be impacted by its results. As a result \\nof this lack of human reconsideration, many receive delayed access, or lose access, to rights, opportunities, benefits, \\nand critical services. The American public deserves the assurance that, when rights, opportunities, or access are \\nmeaningfully at stake and there is a reasonable expectation of an alternative to an automated system, they can conve\\xad\\nniently opt out of an automated system and will not be disadvantaged for that choice. In some cases, such a human or \\nother alternative may be required by law, for example it could be required as “reasonable accommodations” for people \\nwith disabilities. \\nIn addition to being able to opt out and use a human alternative, the American public deserves a human fallback \\nsystem in the event that an automated system fails or causes harm. No matter how rigorously an automated system is \\ntested, there will always be situations for which the system fails. The American public deserves protection via human \\nreview against these outlying or unexpected scenarios. In the case of time-critical systems, the public should not have \\nto wait—immediate human consideration and fallback should be available. In many time-critical systems, such a \\nremedy is already immediately available, such as a building manager who can open a door in the case an automated \\ncard access system fails. \\nIn the criminal justice system, employment, education, healthcare, and other sensitive domains, automated systems \\nare used for many purposes, from pre-trial risk assessments and parole decisions to technologies that help doctors \\ndiagnose disease. Absent appropriate safeguards, these technologies can lead to unfair, inaccurate, or dangerous \\noutcomes. These sensitive domains require extra protections. It is critically important that there is extensive human \\noversight in such settings. \\nThese critical protections have been adopted in some scenarios. Where automated systems have been introduced to \\nprovide the public access to government benefits, existing human paper and phone-based processes are generally still \\nin place, providing an important alternative to ensure access. Companies that have introduced automated call centers \\noften retain the option of dialing zero to reach an operator. When automated identity controls are in place to board an \\nairplane or enter the country, there is a person supervising the systems who can be turned to for help or to appeal a \\nmisidentification. \\nThe American people deserve the reassurance that such procedures are in place to protect their rights, opportunities, \\nand access. People make mistakes, and a human alternative or fallback mechanism will not always have the right \\nanswer, but they serve as an important check on the power and validity of automated systems. \\n• An automated signature matching system is used as part of the voting process in many parts of the country to\\ndetermine whether the signature on a mail-in ballot matches the signature on file. These signature matching\\nsystems are less likely to work correctly for some voters, including voters with mental or physical\\ndisabilities, voters with shorter or hyphenated names, and voters who have changed their name.97 A human\\ncuring process,98 which helps voters to confirm their signatures and correct other voting mistakes, is\\nimportant to ensure all votes are counted,99 and it is already standard practice in much of the country for\\nboth an election official and the voter to have the opportunity to review and correct any such issues.100 \\n47\\n'),\n",

Some panelists suggested that the integration of technology \\ncould benefit from examining how technological diffusion has worked in the realm of urban planning: \\nlessons learned from successes and failures there include the importance of balancing ownership rights, use \\nrights, and community health, safety and welfare, as well ensuring better representation of all voices, \\nespecially those traditionally marginalized by technological advances.

Various panelists raised \\nconcerns about the validity of these systems, the tendency of adverse or irrelevant data to lead to a replication of \\nunjust outcomes, and the confirmation bias and tendency of people to defer to potentially inaccurate automated \\nsystems. Throughout, many of the panelists individually emphasized that the impact of these systems on \\nindividuals and communities is potentially severe: the systems lack individualization and work against the \\nbelief that people can change for the better, system use can lead to the loss of jobs and custody of children, and \\nsurveillance can lead to chilling effects for communities and sends negative signals to community members \\nabout how they're viewed. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \\nthese technologies, various panelists emphasized that transparency is important but is not enough to achieve \\naccountability.

This event explored current and emerging uses of \\ntechnology that impact equity of opportunity in employment, education, and housing. \\nWelcome: \\n•\\nRashida Richardson, Senior Policy Advisor for Data and Democracy, White House Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy\\n•\\nDominique Harrison, Director for Technology Policy, The Joint Center for Political and Economic\\nStudies\\nModerator: Jenny Yang, Director, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor \\nPanelists: \\n•\\nChristo Wilson, Associate Professor of Computer Science, Northeastern University\\n•\\nFrida Polli, CEO, Pymetrics\\n•\\nKaren Levy, Assistant Professor, Department of Information Science, Cornell University\\n•\\nNatasha Duarte, Project Director, Upturn\\n•\\nElana Zeide, Assistant Professor, University of Nebraska College of Law\\n•\\nFabian Rogers, Constituent Advocate, Office of NY State Senator Jabari Brisport and Community\\nAdvocate and Floor Captain, Atlantic Plaza Towers Tenants Association\\nThe individual panelists described the ways in which AI systems and other technologies are increasingly being \\nused to limit access to equal opportunities in education, housing, and employment. Education-related \\nconcerning uses included the increased use of remote proctoring systems, student location and facial \\nrecognition tracking, teacher evaluation systems, robot teachers, and more. Housing-related concerning uses \\nincluding automated tenant background screening and facial recognition-based controls to enter or exit \\nhousing complexes. Employment-related concerning uses included discrimination in automated hiring \\nscreening and workplace surveillance. Various panelists raised the limitations of existing privacy law as a key \\nconcern, pointing out that students should be able to reinvent themselves and require privacy of their student \\nrecords and education-related data in order to do so. The overarching concerns of surveillance in these \\ndomains included concerns about the chilling effects of surveillance on student expression, inappropriate \\ncontrol of tenants via surveillance, and the way that surveillance of workers blurs the boundary between work \\nand life and exerts extreme and potentially damaging control over workers' lives. Additionally, some panelists \\npointed out ways that data from one situation was misapplied in another in a way that limited people's \\nopportunities, for example data from criminal justice settings or previous evictions being used to block further \\naccess to housing. Throughout, various panelists emphasized that these technologies are being used to shift the \\nburden of oversight and efficiency from employers to workers, schools to students, and landlords to tenants, in \\nways that diminish and encroach on equality of opportunity; assessment of these technologies should include \\nwhether they are genuinely helpful in solving an identified problem. \\nIn discussion of technical and governance interventions that that are needed to protect against the harms of \\nthese technologies, panelists individually described the importance of: receiving community input into the \\ndesign and use of technologies, public reporting on crucial elements of these systems, better notice and consent \\nprocedures that ensure privacy based on context and use case, ability to opt-out of using these systems and \\nreceive a fallback to a human process, providing explanations of decisions and how these systems work, the \\nneed for governance including training in using these systems, ensuring the technological use cases are \\ngenuinely related to the goal task and are locally validated to work, and the need for institution and protection \\nof third party audits to ensure systems continue to be accountable and valid. \\n57\\n\"),\n",

Various panelists suggested that these harms could be \\nmitigated by ensuring community input at the beginning of the design process, providing ways to opt out of \\nthese systems and use associated human-driven mechanisms instead, ensuring timeliness of benefit payments, \\nand providing clear notice about the use of these systems and clear explanations of how and what the \\ntechnologies are doing. Some panelists suggested that technology should be used to help people receive \\nbenefits, e.g., by pushing benefits to those in need and ensuring automated decision-making systems are only \\nused to provide a positive outcome; technology shouldn't be used to take supports away from people who need \\nthem. \\nPanel 6: The Healthcare System.
