        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus based on the input query. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input query. This can involve concatenating the retrieved information with the original query or using it to provide additional context.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based model like GPT-3, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The generative model can produce more accurate and contextually relevant answers because it has access to the additional information retrieved in the first step.\\n\\nRAG models are particularly useful in scenarios where the information needed to answer a query is not contained within the model's parameters but can be found in external documents or databases. This approach leverages the strengths of both retrieval and generation, leading to more accurate and informative responses.\""

Here are some key points highlighting its significance:\\n\\n1. **Text Representation**: Tokenization converts raw text into a format that can be processed by the model. It breaks down the text into smaller units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters. This allows the model to handle and understand the text more effectively.\\n\\n2. **Handling Vocabulary**: By breaking text into tokens, LLMs can manage a vast vocabulary. Instead of learning representations for every possible word, subword tokenization (like Byte Pair Encoding or WordPiece) allows the model to handle rare or unseen words by breaking them into known subword units.\\n\\n3. **Efficiency**: Tokenization helps in reducing the complexity of the input data. By converting text into tokens, the model can process the data more efficiently, leading to faster training and inference times.\\n\\n4. **Context Understanding**: Tokenization helps in preserving the context of the text. Proper tokenization ensures that meaningful units of text are kept together, which is essential for the model to understand and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n5. **Handling Different Languages**: Tokenization is particularly important for multilingual models. It allows the model to handle different languages and scripts by breaking down text into a common set of tokens, facilitating cross-lingual understanding and generation.\\n\\n6. **Reducing Ambiguity**: Proper tokenization helps in reducing ambiguity in text. For example, tokenizing \"can\\'t\" into \"can\" and \"\\'t\" helps the model understand the negation, which is crucial for accurate language understanding and generation.\\n\\n7. **Alignment with Model Architecture**: The architecture of LLMs, such as transformers, is designed to work with tokenized input. Tokenization aligns the input text with the model\\'s requirements, ensuring that the data is in the right format for processing.\\n\\nIn summary, tokenization is a fundamental step that enables LLMs to process, understand, and generate human language effectively.

This helps the model understand the context by focusing on relevant parts of the input text.\\n   - **Contextual Embeddings**: Words are represented as vectors that capture their meanings in context. These embeddings are updated at each layer of the model to reflect the context in which the words appear.\\n\\n2. **Memory**:\\n   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Earlier models like RNNs and LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) maintain a hidden state that is updated as each word is processed, allowing the model to remember previous words in the sequence.\\n   - **Transformers**: Transformers, which are the basis for many modern LLMs, do not rely on sequential processing. Instead, they use positional encodings to keep track of the order of words and self-attention to maintain context over long sequences.\\n\\n3. **Tokenization**:\\n   - **Subword Tokenization**: LLMs often use subword tokenization methods like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece to break down words into smaller units. This helps the model handle rare words and understand the context better by focusing on meaningful subword units.\\n\\n4. **Context Windows**:\\n   - **Fixed-Length Context Windows**: LLMs process text in chunks of a fixed length, known as context windows. The size of this window determines how much context the model can consider at once. For example, GPT-3 has a context window of 2048 tokens.\\n   - **Sliding Windows**: For longer texts, a sliding window approach can be used where the model processes overlapping chunks of text to maintain context over longer passages.\\n\\n5. **Fine-Tuning and Pre-Training**:\\n   - **Pre-Training**: LLMs are pre-trained on large corpora of text to learn general language patterns and context handling.\\n   - **Fine-Tuning**: They can be fine-tuned on specific datasets to improve their ability to handle context in particular domains or types of conversations.\\n\\n6. **Prompt Engineering**:\\n   - **Prompt Design**: The way prompts are designed can help LLMs maintain context. For example, including relevant previous conversation turns in the prompt can help the model generate more contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\n7. **Memory-Augmented Models**:\\n   - **External Memory**: Some advanced models incorporate external memory mechanisms that allow them to store and retrieve information over longer conversations, improving their ability to maintain context over extended interactions.\\n\\nThese mechanisms collectively enable LLMs to handle context in conversations, allowing them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.',\n",
